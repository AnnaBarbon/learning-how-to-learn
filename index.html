              Whether it's at school or university, the one thing no one ever teaches you is
              how to teach yourself. We often just end up drilling specific exercises and
              mindlessly memorizing information so that when exam time comes around,
              we pass the test. But once the test is over, that information has outlived its
              usefulness, and there's no guarantee that information will be retained. In the
              end, we're really just learning how to pass our tests.

              <span class="two-columns__span-accent">Here's the real question: </span>does this approach of repetition and
              memorization help us truly understand the subject material? The academic
              consensus nowadays is that it doesn't. In fact, what's more important than
              any individual topic is knowing how to study, but for some reason, this point
              is often overlooked. So, what can we do to remedy this?
